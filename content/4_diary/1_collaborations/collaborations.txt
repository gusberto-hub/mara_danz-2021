It is very important to us to keep the production routes as short as possible in order to gain an insight into the working conditions and to keep the ecological impact as small as possible.<\/p><p>A creative and forward-thinking collaboration has developed between Mara Danz and the company. Mara Danz scoured the company's archives in search of old print designs to breathe new life into them. With the inclusion of innovative printing techniques, the print collection DANZ was born. All fabrics from the collection 'you have a beautful voice' 2022 are silkscreenprinted in Mitloedi, Switzerland. The collection is made out of deadstock fabrics.<\/p>"},"id":"27ee6c64-2298-43d5-a33d-7d9d37b0f8e5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"images":["textildruckerei_mitlodi00004.jpg","textildruckerei_mitlodi00007.jpg"]},"id":"5c5b6f27-84c8-49c3-95db-2441403037b7","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"images":["textildruckerei_mitlodi00008.jpg","textildruckerei_mitlodi00011.jpg"]},"id":"f1d3ca17-7105-411c-a128-75ef8c4a1eb1","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"images":["textildruckerei_mitlodi00013.jpg"]},"id":"2e46c5c1-e463-4bcc-a611-e2279a6a00c9","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>photography by Marius Zweifel<\/p>"},"id":"ebb7f0fa-8e69-40bb-9ff0-df9203b117f8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"fee5d628-6730-40d0-9b30-618f0a391d51","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"5202e1d8-957c-4b96-b449-bb3869221532"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"BELLINGER x DANZ"},"id":"f5fed514-b79a-4c04-a9d8-2b67515a30c6","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Anne Bellinger is a fashion designer from Germany who focuses on the development of unique textiles. <br>For the collection 'you have a beautiful voice' DANZ and Bellinger have created a shoe collection.
